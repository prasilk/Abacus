<h3>Overview of AbacusProject</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp">
AbacusProject was started with the intention providing an extension to your college life. We do this by giving you a platform where we have deployed features that can be accessed by anyone, any-time and anywhere. This website just happens to be what we believe - the most effective medium for it. We assure you that your journey with Abacus is going to be great, but sure you have to understand Abacus amply to make the most out of it. Thence, we've prepared this help page to get you started and make you an "Abacus-Zen" (just kidding) - anyway after reading, you'll be confident enough to find your way while using Abacus. Although you might have sorted out few things here already, we strongly recommend you go through all the topics once without skimming. 

<h3>The Homepage</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp"><br>
<center>
<img src="images/homepage.png" width="70%"></center><br>
This page is the page that opens when you open the website. As you can see it is pretty straightforward - all the features of AbacusProject is listed here so you don't have to worry about finding your ways. Other features can be found an AbacusApps which I will explain later in this documentation. <br><br>

On the top is the top-bar. It contains our logo to the left, AbacusProject name at the center and login/register buttons on the right. The "AbacusProject" name at the center can be clicked and takes you back to the homepage through whichever page you're in. Take it like a shortcut to the homepage. Also this top-bar is fixed and won't move as you scroll though the page. So you can find your way to the homepage via whatever part of website you're in.<br><br>

The page contains the icons that can be clicked. When we say clickable icons, we also mean unclickable text-captions. So if you're clicking any icon, make sure that you click the image part of it not the name underneath. To the bottom lies the footer. It is present on the end of every page of AbacusProject. It gives you the imformation about the website version and other info. 

<h3>Creating an Account</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp"><br>
If you're using this website, creating an account is quite a requisite - although many features of the website can be used without creating an Account. Having an Account gives you full functionality to this website. Creating an Account is simple. Here are the steps :
<ol><li> Click "Register" button on the right side of the top-bar.<br><br>
<li> You'll get a form. On this form there are couple of things that you'll have to take care about. First, username is not as same as your real name (it's recommended that it's does not contain your real name). 'username' tells what you want your name to be displayed on the website. Real name is your real name and is hidden to everyone - used by Abacus only for verification purpose. Secondly, Address is your current address not your permanent address. If you're in a hostel, you could give your hostel room number - if you are fine with it. Lastly, provide legitimate e-mail address because this will be the only way you could recover your password if you forget it. That being said, you're good to go.<br><br>
<li>After filling the form, enter the text-verification code. It is to ensure that you're a human and not a robot. Robots are like viruses for website. They can do stuffs on their own and this text verification is the only way of preventing them from doing so.<br><br>

<li>Click on "Register" button. If everything is fine, you'll get a success page. Else, you'll get an error page. Possible cause for the ERROR : <ul>
<li>You left a field blank - Filling all the fields is mandatory. Click on "Try Again" button to go back and check which field you left empty.
<li>Your USN was already registered. Duplicate accounts with same USN is not allowed. If someone illegitimately used your USN number, send us an e-mail at abacusnhce@hotmail.com with some proof of verification and we can take it up from there. But it is really rare that your USN could be used illegitimately because while verification, we cross check the phone number and the USN, anyway you now know what you should be doing then. </ul> </ol>
Your Account is now created - but it is unverified. This means that your Account is not yet fully functional for the website. The next step is Account Verification - it's easier said than done. We'll see it in the next section.

<h3>Account Verification - Why & How</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp">
Account Verification is your way of proving that you exist and you're a student of NHCE. If there were no verification of Account, anyone could create an Account - even those who are not from NHCE - alright lets face it, even a person from Ethopia could be creating an account and posting stuffs. We don't want all of these to happen. We want only the people who are studying on NHCE to be posting things. So, only the people who have verified their Account can post things. Now, we also want instant posting be made possible. So even with your unverified account, you could post, but it would be posted on the 'Unverified Posts' page which obviously draws lower attention - anyway better than nothing right? (just kidding). Anyway, after your account gets verified all your unverified posts gets converted into verified posts. <br><br>

There are 3 ways by which you could verify your Account : <ol>
<li><b>Verify by a Friend : </b> This is probably the most easiest way of verifying your account. If you know anyone who has a verified account, you could ask them to verify your account - if they haven't verified anyone already. The matter is - a verified user can verify only 1 other user, not more than that. But again, if they verify your account, you could verify another account - so the cycle gets going, and there'll be lots of people who could be verifying accounts. If you find a friend with a verified account and hasn't verified anyone already, tell them to go to <a href="verify.php">Verify Account</a> page and follow the instructions. Verifying by this method get's your account verified instantly. So this is the best method to follow.<br><br>
<li><b>Sending a SMS : </b> This is another way to verify your account - and is not as fast as the one above. Anyway, after you've created your account, send a SMS with your USN Number with the same phone number you provided while creating your account. Send your sms to +91-9972985261. It could take a day or two to verify your account this way. You can check the verified accounts page to know if it has been verified already. <br><br>

<li><b>Wait : </b> There are 2 things that happen to an unverified account - either it gets verified or gets deleted. If you have given true information about yourself while creating an Account, it will get verified automatically - in a day or even in hours - depends on the moderators. But if you've given sour information about yourself, needless to say, your account will be deleted. So you could just wait to see what happens. We'll send an e-mail to your mailbox on confirmation. </ol>

Now that you've created an Account, let's see how to post an item for sale.

<h3>Selling via Abacus</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp">
Selling has a separate box - you can see it on the homepage. There are 2 ways you could sell your item : for money or for free. If you're selling for money click on normal sell option. If you're giving it away for free, click on the "Free Giveaway" option. Here're the steps on filling the form : <ol>

<li>Give your item name. Be precise here and just give its name. It supports maximum 30 characters so whatever you write beyond that will be omitted. The reason why we kept this letter limit is so you'll be precise about your item when you're giving it's name. <br><br>

<li>Give it a category. By default, it will be categorised as miscellaneous. Category is essential because it helps other users to filter items while they're browsing the buy list. We'll talk more about categories later on but for now, make sure that you provided suitable category for the item that you wanted to sell. <br><br>

<li>Give a description about your item. This is the place where you're supposed to mention it's specifications, et cetrea. You can give a long description about your item here and is not bound to any limit (well practically, the limit is 65580 letters, but I guess that's quite much for it). <br><br>

<li>Give a reasonable price in Indian Rupees. After filling everything give your USN number and your account password and click on Post option. Your post will be posted automatically. If you have an unverified account, your post will be posted on the unverified posts' list. </ol>

Now let's learn more about categories.

<h3>What are categories</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp">
Categories provide an easy way for users to browse items on what they need. On Abacus, there are 5 categories an item could be posted on. Here's some insight for each of them : <ul>
<li><b>Misc : </b> This is the default category. If you think that none of the default category fits for your item, go with this category. <br><br>

<li><b>Book/Note : </b> If you have any book/Reference/Study Stuff than you can post it with this category. You could also post any academic stuff although it's only for Books and Notes (People who love "academic" stuffs are also most likely the people who like books). So you can use this category for those items also.<br><br>

<li><b>Cellphone : </b> As the name suggests, it is the category that you want to use if you're selling away your cellphone. This category can also be used for other "phonic" stuffs like tablets or e-readers. If you're selling accessories for cellphone like headsets, memory cards, you can also sell it under this category. <br><br>

<li><b>Computer : </b> Here you can sell your computer or computer accessories like pen drive, external Hard Drive, Mouse, etc. Non-electronic stuff does not belong to this category. Anything that has a processor and is not a mobile phone or a tablet can be posted on this category. <br><br>

<li><b>Accessory : </b> It belongs to every other thing that just enhances your life. For instance, a guitar, MIDI keyboard, a wrist watch, I don't know but the items that are there to provide an extension to your life. Oh and the shades too. </ul>

<h3>Your Profile</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp">
Your profile can be accessed in many ways. First, from the users list. If your account is verified, it will be visible on the verified accounts' list which you can access from the homepage. If your account is not verified, it will be visible on the unverified accounts' list which also can be accessed from the homepage. Click on your name to open up your profile. The second way to access your profile is from the post. If you post any item, your information and a link to your profile will be on the post description.<br><br>

In your profile, on the top, you can see your basic information. Below that you can see the items that you've posted. You can click on the items for more actions like deleting them or making them sold. The items are sorted from newest to oldest - in top bottom manner. This page also has buttons to edit your profile and to delete your profile. The instructions for each actions will be in their respective pages. <br><br>

<h3>Abacus Apps</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp">
This is one of the most exciting things about AbacusProject. Here you can find applications that can perform different fuctions that provide additional functionality to our Project. Most of the applications need an account and so you can use your Abacus Account to get in. Also note that only verified accounts are supported. We have all these applications Open-Sourced so if you want to improve any applications you can download the source code, modify it and send it back to us so we can update it. Anyone can make an app for Abacus, and basically we'll keep it there for free. You don't need to have much in-depth knowledge about programming to make an app - just create a HTML project with features that could be useful to Abacus Community. More information on how to make an app for Abacus will be posted later. <br><br>

<h3>More help & support</h3><hr id="menuhrhelp">
So this will be pretty much it for now. Full documentation will be published later when we'll move to beta. If you have any further queries / suggestions / complaints , you sure can personally write to me at prasilkoirala@hotmail.com or to the support team at abacusnhce@hotmail.com . We hope that you'll enjoy using this project as much as we enjoyed developing it. <br><br>Thank you for everything. :)<br>(Warm Hugs)
