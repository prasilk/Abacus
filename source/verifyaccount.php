<h2>10 Reasons to join Abacus</h2>

<ol>

    <li>We believe that any service that could be useful to anyone should not be marginalized - so AbacusProject is for everyone - any student student in NHCE has equal rights to what we offer. We treat each user with equal priority - no one has the right to call themself more valuable to our service.<br><br>
	
    <li>We value your parents' hard earned money. You don't have to pay to use Abacus - and nothing up the sleeves. If you consider supporting our project you can donate to us - 20 users donating Rs. 100 each would be sufficient to maintain the costs of the website for 1 year.<br><br>

    * Also as a note, we won't be including advertisements here. Frankly, no one likes advertisement on websites - neither do we. We want our users to immerse into the content of what we have to offer rather than those wet promotions which advertisements render.<br><br>
	
    <li>We believe that for anything to be viable, it must also be flexible. So abacus is not limited to selling your riffed items - it offers you AbacusApps where you can find applications that extend Abacus functionality. The best part about AbacusApps is that it is not bound to any restrictions to what you are supposed to develop - anyone with any idea to help the Abacus community in any way via webapp can develop and we'll keep it there for free.<br><br>
	
    <li>We believe in freedom. We don't want you to think Abacus as being some sort of untouchable entity - rather we want you to see inside Abacus, how it works, exploit - improve. Therefore, the software that powers Abacus is open-sourced to everyone. There's no patent, no copyright infringements, and the whole project is licensed under GNU General Public License - all because we believe in a free world.<br><br>
	
    <li>We respect your online-privacy. We believe that everyone has the right to privacy. So we don't force our users to use their real name while using our service. We also strictly abide by 'no-profile-picture' rule - so you can use our serivice without worries. In the same way we also expect our users to honor our rules for joining Abacus, and not provide sour imformation about themselves. Needless to say, such accounts will be blocked.<br><br>
	
    <li>We believe that for anything to be strong in itself, it needs a strong framework. We've worked hard to make Abacus the best of what we can - so we cannot compromise on the framework on which it works. Therefore, we have deployed Abacus on world's #1 Web-Hosting service with dedicated RAM and CPU index. So you, as a user won't have to worry about the website being down due to high traffic - there's no traffic as high that can bring us down, and we mean it.<br><br>
	
    <li>We offer no discrimination. We believe that the more we can make Abacus compatable, the more it becomes accessible. We brag Abacus to be compatable on virtually on all devices that supports internet connectivity - even the command line browsers like Links for GNU Systems, it is compatable everywhere. Also, we've worked hard to make the page as much low-sized as possible, so that you can use Abacus even with slow internet connectivity.<br><br>
	
    <li>We believe in free-speech - and we don't like government trying to bring us down. Being well aware about the NSA revelations by Edward Snowden, it seems very resonable to avoid mainstream social networking sites like facebook, Google+, or virtually any service that asks for your real name. So have set our page on reddit - which is by the way the best platform that we believe to share updates anonymously. You are welcome to join us there. Here's the link : www.reddit.com/r/abacusproject<br><br>
	
    <li>We are driven by service, not by profit. Abacus was not made because things have to be done, but rather focusing on how things are done. We take care on every step how we are doing things and whether it is the right way - and it it's not, we don't hesitate to brush it off. It's not what Abacus does makes it what it is - it's how Abacus does makes it what it is.<br><br>
	
    <li>We believe in freedom of choice. "When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man." So we have let our service at your choice. We don't force you to join Abacus, and neither do we block off the option to leave. The simple it is to join Abacus, the simpler it is to delete your account - if you are dissatisfied. The more we're open to compliments, the more we're open to criticisms. So it is up to you if you want to join us - and we'll always keep that choice open to you.<br><br>

    Thank you. <br><br>
