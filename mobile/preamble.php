<h2>Preamble</h2>

Let me start off by saying how I came to develop this project. It was the beginning of my second semester. All tight for the mayhem, and all that is, preparation sort of for classes. There were 2 things I had to get done - get rid of my old book, didn't want to see them anymore (Maths-I, I am saying that to you!). Yeah so, I figured out that I might give it to the old guy of the College Book Shop - Nirvana that is (Don't get mused by the name, it's just a regular book store, nothing to fancy about). I wanted to exchange em' for the other old books for the semester, but misfortune it may be, none were available. I don't remember how much did I get paid but that was just about enough to buy a new Maths II book, and that was all. The rest, I somehow managed to get from the Library - in all that hustle for renewal every 14 days or so - for every book, damn. <br><br>

Couple of days I thought, there must be some way of getting used books - and Nirvana wasn't the best source. I thought about it for quite a while. A fine morning it was, it was clear in my head, and I knew exactly what I had to do. "Connection" - it was all about it. If I could somehow connect all my brothers (friends, that is) to each other, would solve the problem. But as simpler it sounds, the more complicated it gets when you actually think about building connections between brothers of this 'not so small college' housing somewhat 8000 students. 8000 is a big number, at least to me. There was no way all these brothers could be addressed into a common objective for sharing, and facilitating them with this vague term - "Connection" was even more coarse. <br><br>

I had to find a way of building connection that was easier, yet robust where all my brothers could comply with the common goal of sharing - afterall, "Sharing is caring", right? I had to think of this connection 'so-instantly-reachable' that there would be no delay in helping other brother by one brother. It should be accessible by all - no discrimination at all, and anytime, and anywhere, and definitely free - for help should always be free, brothers. <br><br>

It didn't take me long to figure out what I had to do, but this thing - I wasn't sure was the best thing, for my inexperience in it - but it was the best thing that could be done. It was a 'Web-Service'. I thought, everyone could access the web, web is there everywhere, and anytime - therefore. It was a great idea, but I doubted whether it could be done by me - solely. Not that I didn't have knowledge on how to do it, but I didn't exactly know how could I make it work. Anyway, I was deemed for it, and from that day, I started working on my first project - I gave it the name : Abacus, cause Abacus was a device that was helpful for so many people, so long - and I wanted by Project to be helpful - like the Abacus, don't take it too literally though.<br><br>

So here it is - Abacus that you are using. I don't know if it could be helpful, but it won't be a disgrace - for this website was built for a good reason. And a goodness is all that matters - above all, right brothers? The reason 1 I built this website is for "Connection" and the reason 2 is to show the power engulfed in 'Free-Software' - if you're new to this term, don't worry you are not the only one - for the venom of proprietary software is everywhere, and you my brother, are just a cheerful victim, victim of the modern age, victim of these so called Corporations that view people just as some puppets for money, and take away your natural right to freedom. I'll explain.<br><br>

Although what I am going to explain is somewhat off the topic (for the context of this website) and I might sound bit technical but it is important to know, brothers - for you have a natural right to know the truth, and truth is all that I am going to explain. I am talking about 'Software'. Although you may take this term lightly, labelling it nothing much than things to install on your computer, but my brother, it is much more than that. Software is the gift of human creativity - for it took us 6 million years to master.<br><br>

Everything began with progressive learning. The reason why we are here - this way - with knowledge so great that we could summon the depts of your home planet, or fly to the vast void into the space - is because of progressive learning. Early cavemen were wise. They taught us how to make a fire and thanks to them that we can have cooked meals without the risk of bacterial infection, and make ourselves warm during cold winter nights. Thanks to Wright Brothers - for they taught us to fly - high above the ground. The reason why we have been able to make such Air-planes - faster than the speed of sound is because Wright Brothers shared their knowledge to the world. Now just think how would it been if the early cavemen patented the ability to make a fire, and only they would be the ones who would make fire, imagine what would happen if Wright Brothers patented Air-planes and would make it illegal to reverse engineer their air-planes. It would disrupt the flow of progressive learning and would disrupt the human evolution itself. Knowledge is meant to be shared - and not to be owned. No one has the right to own knowledge - for all we know is because of people who shared their knowledge. <br><br>
