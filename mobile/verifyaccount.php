<h2>10 Reasons to join Abacus</h2>
<ol>
<li>Abacus is free to use - Nothing up the sleeves, and free Forever. ( :-) )<hr>
<li>You can sell anything here (Don't take 'anything' too literally). In the same manner, you can see what others have posted for sale and buy it, if you want to (double check your pocket, though). <hr>
<li>If you are not into this sell/buy thing, you can always explore AbacusApps where you can find applications that extend Abacus functionality. (A free sms App could be awesome, right?) <hr>

<li>Abacus is free-software. We do believe in freedom. Therefore Abacus is never outofdate. If you have good knowledge in web-development using free-software, you could also contribute to the development of Abacus. ( If you don't know what free-software is, well nevermind.) <hr>
<li>Registration is simple, yet secure. You don't have to upload anything for verification, just make sure that you entered your phone number right. Abacus is based on Trust. (This does not mean that we trust you everytime - an account with fake info will be deleted.) <hr>
<li>Abacus is powered by the world's #1 Web-Hosting Company - GoDaddy with dedicated RAM and CPU power. So you don't have to worry about the server being down due to high traffic. ( If you are wondering about what it means for server being down, remember accessing VTU results site on the day of results? That's not a problem here.)  <hr>
<li>Abacus is light. It works in every Computer, every Operating System, any Browser. Tested with NHCE Library computers and works like charm (amazingly!). If you don't use a graphical user interface and use command-line browsers, it's perfectly compatable there too. Plus, each page is less than 1 kilobyte - which means you could use this website with pathetic internet speeds. ( Can confirm - tested with NHCE Library Computer Internet ) <hr>
<li>Abacus is NSA proof. You won't find any facebook plugins, social networking buttons or all those rubbish. It is clean; built up from scratch. Blue in colour because blue = sky and sky = Freedom. ( And Pink Floyd being all there with me while coding.) <hr>
<li>(Beware : too much of narcissism here ) Abacus not built by those grounded web-developers. It was not made because things have to be done, but rather focusing on how things are done. Abacus has it's philosophy.
 <hr>
<li>Abacus is very good at grammar.
