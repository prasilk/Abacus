<h2>Get involved</h2>
It's not very hard to support this project - don't worry, it won't include any financial contributions. Well the best way to help is to publicize, cause the more people know about this website, the more people would be using it. And the more people using this website = more people posting stuffs - which would ultimately be better off for everyone. You can publicize it as personally to your friends (only to those who study at NHCE). <br><br>

The other way is by contributing to the code development. Anyone who uses 'free-software' for the development are welcome to contribute. Windows/Mac OSes is discouraged for development - as part of Abacus Philosophy. Preferred operating system : Debian. If you don't know what Debian is, you probably are not ready to improve the code that powers Abacus (don't take it in a harsh way).
